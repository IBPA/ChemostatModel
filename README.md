### What is Chemostat Model?

Chemostat Model is a program to predict and understand the growth dynamics of Escherichia coli in long-term chemostat.

### How to run

  1. Copy the source file Chemostat_Model.m into your work directory.
  2. Create a folder named "Data" in your work directory.
  3. Run the function Chemostat_Model

### Expected results

Upon completion (running time < 30 seconds), you will have the following results

Figures

  1. Plot for different ratios of K_C / K_M  
  2. Plot the model with Hill function for the glycerol
  3. Plot of the Herbert model
  4. Plot of the extended model

Files in the 'Data' folder

  1. 3 files for different values of K_C
  2. 4 data files of the Hill function
  3. 4 data files of the Herbert model
  4. 4 data files of the extended model
